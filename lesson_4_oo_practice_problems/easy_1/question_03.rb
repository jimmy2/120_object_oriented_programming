# Lesson 4: OO Practice Problems > Practice Problems: Easy 1

# In the last question we had a module called Speed which contained a go_fast
# method. We included this module in the Car class as shown below.

=begin
  
module Speed
  def go_fast
    puts "I am a #{self.class} and going super fast!"
  end
end

class Car
  include Speed
  def go_slow
    puts "I am safe and driving slow."
  end
end
  
=end

# When we called the go_fast method from an instance of the Car class 
# (as shown below) you might have noticed that the string printed when we go
# fast includes the name of the type of vehicle we are using. How is this done?

# small_car = Car.new
# small_car.go_fast
# => I am a Car and going super fast!

# We called self.class on the object.

# Their Answer

# We use self.class in the method and this works the following way:

# 1.  self refers to the object itself, in this case either a Car or Truck object.
# 2.  We ask self to tell us its class with .class. It tells us.
# 3.  We don't need to use to_s here because it is inside of a string and is
# interpolated which means it will take care of the to_s for us.
